echo "This is a placeholder build script. It shows typical steps but requires local Simplicity toolchain."

# Example (replace commands with your toolchain's actual commands)
# 1. Compile SimplicityHL to core Simplicity
# simplicityc contracts/vault.simphl -o out/vault.sim

# 2. Optionally, produce a scriptPubKey / commitment to place in a transaction
# simplicityc --to-script out/vault.sim > out/vault_script.hex

# 3. Use Elements / Liquid tooling to create a funding tx with the script
# elements-cli createrawtransaction ... (construct with vault_script.hex as scriptPubKey)

echo "Done. Install Simplicity compiler and Elements to execute these steps."
