-- SimplicityHL for simplicityc (best-effort, requires your simplicityc toolchain)
-- Filename: vault.simplicityc.simphl
-- NOTE: This file is a best-effort translation of the prototype pseudocode to a form compatible with Blockstream's simplicityc toolchain.
-- You will likely need to adjust primitive names or import the right standard library modules used in your simplicityc installation.
-- The contract implements: k-of-m multisig OR (timelock AND reduced-multisig) OR (emergency_pubkey after emergency_lock)

-- High level assumptions:
-- * Primitives available: ec_verify, count_set_bits, ge (>=), load_u32/load_u64, bitmask operations, DEBUG/ASSERT as needed.
-- * Input encoding: The contract expects a tuple (args, current_height)
--   where args is a record-like tuple:
--     (sigmask, pubkeys_blob, sigs_blob, locktime, emergency_lock, emergency_pubkey, emergency_sig)
--   Encoding of blobs (pubkeys_blob, sigs_blob) is application-level; the contract uses ec_verify on per-pubkey sigs extracted.

-- === Helper combinators ===
-- These are written at a high level; replace with actual combinator implementations per your toolchain.

-- Extractors (placeholders)
let get_sigmask = take  -- args -> sigmask
let get_pubkeys_blob = drop  -- args -> pubkeys_blob
-- (In real SimplicityHL you'll use pair/take/drop to extract specific tuple fields)

-- Multisig check: verify at least k bits set and corresponding signatures validate.
-- This is provided as a single combinator `multisig_check k m` to keep the high-level logic clear.
-- Implement this by iterating over m pubkeys, verifying ec_verify for each set bit in sigmask,
-- counting verified signatures, and comparing with k.

-- For simplicity, we present multisig_check as a witness-enabled primitive:
witness "multisig_check_k_of_m" : (Bitmask × PubkeysBlob × SigsBlob) -> Bool.

-- Reduced multisig (k' threshold)
witness "multisig_check_kp_of_m" : (Bitmask × PubkeysBlob × SigsBlob) -> Bool.

-- ECVerify for emergency key
witness "ec_verify_emergency" : (EmergencySig × EmergencyPubkey × Digest) -> Bool.

-- Ge comparator for heights
witness "ge_u32" : (u32 × u32) -> Bool.

-- Main vault predicate
-- Input: (args, current_height)
-- args encoded as tuple: (sigmask, pubkeys_blob, sigs_blob, locktime, emergency_lock, emergency_pubkey, emergency_sig)
